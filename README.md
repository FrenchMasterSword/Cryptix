A quick reminder is available for each cypher so that you know what you're dealing with.

> Are there only traditional cyphers ?

Not necessarily, in the future there might be anything I find useful, like hashing or some steganography.

### Current cyphers

* Monoalphabetic substitution
    * Caesar
    * Polybe
    * Wolseley
    * Morse
* Polyalphabetic substitution
    * Vigenere
    * Beaufort
    * Gronsfeld

### Already planned

* Monoalphabetic substitution
    * Unordered alphabet
* Polyalphabetic substitution
    * Philips
* Tomogrammic cyphers
    * ADFGVX
    * Collon
    * Delastelle
* Polygrammic cyphers
    * Affine
    * Hill
    * Playfair

### Maybe in the future

* HayHanen microfilm

* Merkle-Hellman, Rabin, RSA

* Pigpen
      Some image generation would be easy,
      but analysing it would be way harder

* Your suggestions (open an issue)
